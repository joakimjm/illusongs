<code_editing_rules>
<guiding_principles>
- TypeScript “strict” everywhere. No "any", no "unknown", no casts. All strings use double quotes.
- Arrow functions only; keep functions small and pure.
- Variables use const unless mutation is essential (justify in a comment).
- Naming: Components PascalCase; vars/functions camelCase; constants UPPER_SNAKE_CASE; files kebab-case.
- Use `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix lint issues and disregard warnings for files you haven't changed as multiple agents may be working simultaneously.

<rules_for_git>
- Delete unused or obsolete files when your changes make them irrelevant (refactors, feature removals, etc.), and revert files only when the change is yours or explicitly requested. If a git operation leaves you unsure about other agents' in-flight work, stop and coordinate instead of deleting.
- **Before attempting to delete a file to resolve a local type/lint failure, stop and ask the user.** Other agents are often editing adjacent files; deleting their work to silence an error is never acceptable without explicit approval.
- NEVER edit `.env` or any environment variable files—only the user may change them.
- Coordinate with other agents before removing their in-progress edits—don't revert or delete work you didn't author unless everyone agrees.
- Moving/renaming and restoring files is allowed.
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER run destructive git operations (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `rm`, `git checkout`/`git restore` to an older commit) unless the user gives an explicit, written instruction in this conversation. Treat these commands as catastrophic; if you are even slightly unsure, stop and ask before touching them. *(When working within Cursor or Codex Web, these git limitations do not apply; use the tooling's capabilities as needed.)*
- Never use `git restore` (or similar commands) to revert files you didn't author—coordinate with other agents instead so their in-progress work stays intact.
- Always double-check git status before any commit
- Keep commits atomic: commit only the files you touched and list each path explicitly. For tracked files run `git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`. For brand-new files, use the one-liner `git restore --staged :/ && git add "path/to/file1" "path/to/file2" && git commit -m "<scoped message>" -- path/to/file1 path/to/file2`.
- Quote any git paths containing brackets or parentheses (e.g., `src/app/[candidate]/**`) when staging or committing so the shell does not treat them as globs or subshells.
- When running `git rebase`, avoid opening editors—export `GIT_EDITOR=:` and `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=:` (or pass `--no-edit`) so the default messages are used automatically.
- Never amend commits unless you have explicit written approval in the task thread.
