<code_editing_rules>
<guiding_principles>
- TypeScript “strict” everywhere. No "any", no "unknown", no casts. All strings use double quotes.
- Arrow functions only; keep functions small and pure.
- Variables use const unless mutation is essential (justify in a comment).
- Naming: Components PascalCase; vars/functions camelCase; constants UPPER_SNAKE_CASE; files kebab-case.
